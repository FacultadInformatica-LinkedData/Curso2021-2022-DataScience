<h2>Application Requirements</h2>
<p>The objective is to analyze which types of vehicles consume the most in order to draw
    conclusions in relation to less polluting transport in cities, economic transport alternatives
    and the evaluation of the different car brands. Also, we want to make market analyses that allow
    us to launch projections and compare them with current (and future) stock market values. </p>
